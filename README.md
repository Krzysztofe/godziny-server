# Godziny - React/TS, Express, Mongoose

"Godziny" is full-stack commercial project designed for the presidium of a trade union's workers council to plan the so-called union hours. In Poland, the presidium of the trade union's council is entitled to use hours for union activities. Once the number of hours for the month is determined, the members of the presidium provide the employer with data on the number of hours taken on specific days of the month. Subsequently, the employer can either accept or reject the request for union hours.
